# v0.1.3

## Highlights
- Scripts now expose schema via embedded `OMAKURE_SCHEMA_START/END` blocks read directly from files (no script execution).
- Environments screen includes a live preview panel with scroll support for env files.
- Schema preview shows full Outputs and Queue details, including sizes.

## Added
- Embedded schema block parsing with per-extension comment prefixes.
- `Outputs` and `Queue` metadata support for future orchestration.
- Environments preview panel with `PgUp/PgDn/Home/End` scrolling.

## Changed
- Schema loading uses file content instead of running scripts in `SCHEMA_MODE`.
- Script templates (`init`) now embed schema blocks in Bash/PowerShell/Python.
- Azure sample scripts migrated to embedded schema blocks.
- Docs updated to describe embedded schema blocks, env preview, and queue/outputs display.

## Fixed
- Cleaned schema preview data paths to include outputs/queue details in TUI.
